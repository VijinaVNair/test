    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">1️⃣ Self Introduction<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>First of all, thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself. I'm Vijina V. Nair from Kerala, and I'm currently pursuing my final year in Computer Engineering at LBS College of Engineering, Kasaragod.</p>
      <p>I would describe myself as an energetic and people-oriented individual who thrives on collaboration. I enjoy sharing ideas, learning through real-world experiences, and working in teams to achieve common goals. I adapt quickly to new situations and maintain a positive, solution-focused approach even when faced with challenges. I enjoy taking initiative but also value listening and learning from others. What motivates me most are small but meaningful accomplishments—solving a problem, helping someone overcome a difficulty, or making a positive impact within my team.</p>
      <p>Apart from academics, I'm passionate about teaching high school students at a tuition center, where I enjoy simplifying concepts and inspiring young learners. I also work as an anchor for public events like weddings and other functions, which has strengthened my communication and stage-handling skills.</p>
      <p>Academically, I have built a solid foundation in programming and AI technologies. I work with Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL. Recently, I completed an AI and Python internship at PACELAB, Kochi, where I strengthened my AI fundamentals and applied them to practical tasks. Some of my key projects include a Malayalam Voice Assistant for College Administration, which helps students and staff access academic information in their regional language, and a Pet Adoption Portal, which connects shelters with people interested in adopting pets.</p>
      <p>Looking ahead, I aim to become a professional who works with cutting edge technologies such as AI and automation, while ensuring my work is always connected to real-world needs. My goal is to keep learning, stay adaptable, and contribute meaningfully in every role I take on.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">3️⃣ Hobbies<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Apart from my studies, I enjoy engaging in creative and productive activities. I love exploring new technologies, building small projects, and improving my problem-solving skills. I also enjoy reading, learning new languages, and participating in events or competitions where I can challenge myself. I've read a few self-development books that really inspired me — like The Power of Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy and Atomic Habits by James Clear. In my free time, I like to listen to music, explore new ideas, and sometimes get involved in activities like coordination and volunteering, which help me improve teamwork and leadership.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">4️⃣ Strengths<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>My key strengths are teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and adaptability. For example, as the NRPF Regional Student Coordinator, I worked closely with multiple teams to organize events, which strengthened my teamwork and communication skills. During the events, unexpected challenges would arise, and I had to quickly find solutions, which enhanced my problem-solving ability. I also learned to adapt to changing situations and priorities, ensuring tasks were completed efficiently without compromising quality. Additionally, I am a quick learner, which helped me take on new responsibilities confidently.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">5️⃣ Weakness<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>My biggest weakness is that I sometimes find it hard to say no to people. In the past, this made me take on too many tasks and feel a bit overwhelmed. But I've learned from that experience — now, before I agree to something new, I take a moment to look at my current workload and make sure I have the time and energy to do it well.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">6️⃣ Why Should We Hire You?<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>You should select me because I'm a dedicated and responsible person who always gives my best. I have a strong foundation in programming, especially in Python, and I'm always eager to learn and grow. I work well in a team, communicate clearly, and can handle pressure without losing focus. I've also successfully led projects, which taught me how to take initiative and deliver results. I may be at the beginning of my career, but I'm passionate, hardworking, and ready to make a meaningful contribution from day one.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">7️⃣ Higher Education<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>

    <div class="description">
      <p>I'm more focused on getting a good learning environment where I can grow and improve my technical skills. I believe that once I perform well and keep learning, salary growth will naturally follow. I also trust that the company offers a fair package for freshers based on industry standards, so I'm comfortable with the standard compensation for this role.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">9️⃣ Willingness to Relocate<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>I would like to relocate for the sake of my career. It's a good way for me to meet new people and expand my network. I believe that it will improve my knowledge and also, I believe that relocation teaches how to change or work with new colleagues.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">🔟 Learning New Things<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>I'm very comfortable learning new things — in fact, I really enjoy it. I believe continuous learning helps me grow both personally and professionally.

That's exactly how I learned Python and other technical concepts. I see new things as opportunities to improve, not as challenges.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">1️⃣1️⃣ Preparation for Interview<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">1️⃣2️⃣ Challenges as a Team<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>During my final year project, our team faced significant challenges related to communication and coordination. As the project leader, I noticed that our team members had different schedules and varying expectations, which led to misunderstandings and delays. To address this, I implemented weekly team meetings where we could all come together to discuss progress, clarify doubts, and realign our tasks. I also encouraged open and transparent communication, ensuring that everyone's ideas and concerns were heard and respected. As a result, our team's collaboration improved significantly. We became more organized, met our deadlines, and ultimately delivered a successful project. This experience taught me that effective communication and proactive planning are key to overcoming team challenges and achieving our goals.</p>

    <div class="topic" data-categories="hr">1️⃣9️⃣ Leadership<span class="topic-icon">▶</span></div>
    <div class="description">
      <p>Yes, I do think I have leadership qualities. I was the project leader for my final-year project — the Malayalam Voice Assistant for College Administration. I guided my team, planned our tasks, and made sure we finished everything on time. Apart from that, I was also the NRPF Regional Student Coordinator under the NSS Cell of KTU, where I got to organize activities and coordinate with students from different colleges. Both experiences really helped me grow — I learned how to communicate better, solve problems calmly, and keep everyone motivated.</p>
      <p>If I'm selected as the team leader, I'll focus on good communication first. I'll make sure everyone understands their role and feels comfortable sharing ideas. I believe a team works best when everyone feels included and respected. I'll plan the work clearly, set small goals, and keep regular check-ins to track progress. If any issue comes up, I'll handle it calmly, discuss it with the team, and find the best solution together. My aim would be to keep the team motivated and make sure we deliver quality work on time.</p>
