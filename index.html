Thank you for giving me this opportunity to introduce myself.
If I had to describe my journey so far, I’d say it’s been shaped by curiosity, collaboration, and communication. I’ve always been someone who enjoys connecting with people — learning from them, exchanging ideas, and working together. Whether it’s solving a problem with a team or understanding a concept along with peers, I believe in shared progressOver time, I’ve learned to adapt quickly and stay calm under pressure. I find challenges as an opportunity to push me to think creatively and find solutions. I like taking initiative, but I equally value listening as well.
Outside academics, two experiences have truly shaped my personality. One is teaching high school students at a tuition center, which helped me build patience and bring clarity in communication. The other is my role as an anchor for public events like weddings and cultural functions, which has made me more confident on stage and comfortable interacting with diverse audiences.
Academically, my interests lie in Programming and Artificial Intelligence. I work with Python, C, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, and I recently completed an AI and Python internship at PACELAB, Kochi, where I got to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios.
Among the projects I’ve worked on, two stand out — a Malayalam Voice Assistant for College Administration, designed to help students and staff access information in their regional language, and a Pet Adoption Portal, which connects shelters with potential adopters. Both taught me how technology can make a real difference in everyday life.
Looking ahead, I aspire to work on cutting-edge technologies like AI and automation — areas that align closely with LTI Mindtree’s focus on innovation, digital transformation, and customer-centric solutions. My goal is to keep learning, stay adaptable, and contribute meaningfully to every project I’m part of.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Apart from my studies, I enjoy engaging in creative and productive activities. I love exploring new technologies, building small projects, and improving my problem-solving skills. I also enjoy reading, learning new languages, and participating in events or competitions where I can challenge myself. I’ve read a few self-development books that really inspired me — like The Power of Subconscious Mind by Joseph Murphy and Atomic Habits by James Clear. In my free time, I like to listen to music, explore new ideas, and sometimes get involved in activities like coordination and volunteering, which help me improve teamwork and leadership.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
My key strengths are teamwork, problem-solving, communication, and adaptability. For example, as the NRPF Regional Student Coordinator, I worked closely with multiple teams to organize events, which strengthened my teamwork and communication skills. During the events, unexpected challenges would arise, and I had to quickly find solutions, which enhanced my problem-solving ability. I also learned to adapt to changing situations and priorities, ensuring tasks were completed efficiently without compromising quality. Additionally, I am a quick learner, which helped me take on new responsibilities confidently

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
My biggest weakness is that I sometimes find it hard to say no to people. In the past, this made me take on too many tasks and feel a bit overwhelmed. But I’ve learned from that experience — now, before I agree to something new, I take a moment to look at my current workload and make sure I have the time and energy to do it well.

I’m very comfortable learning new things — in fact, I really enjoy it. I believe continuous learning helps me grow both personally and professionally.

During my final year project, our team faced significant challenges related to communication and coordination. As the project leader, I noticed that our team members had different schedules and varying expectations, which led to misunderstandings and delays. To address this, I implemented weekly team meetings where we could all come together to discuss progress, clarify doubts, and realign our tasks. I also encouraged open and transparent communication, ensuring that everyone’s ideas and concerns were heard and respected. As a result, our team’s collaboration improved significantly. We became more organized, met our deadlines, and ultimately delivered a successful project. This experience taught me that effective communication and proactive planning are key to overcoming team challenges and achieving our goals.

Pet Adoption Project – Interview Q&A
________________________________________
1. What is your project?
Brief Answer:
The project is a Pet Adoption System where users can view available pets, adopt them, and shelters can list pets online. It simplifies the adoption process and improves pet welfare.
Long Answer:
The Pet Adoption System is a comprehensive platform connecting pet shelters with potential adopters. Users can browse pets by type, age, or location, submit adoption requests, and communicate with shelters. Shelters can manage pet profiles, track adoption status, and update availability. This reduces manual paperwork and ensures pets are adopted faster. The system improves the overall efficiency of pet adoption while ensuring better care and management of animals.
________________________________________
2. How does it work?
Brief Answer:
Users create accounts, search for pets, view details, and submit adoption requests. Shelters receive notifications and approve or reject requests. The system maintains adoption history and updates pet status.
Long Answer:
The system follows a user-friendly workflow. Users register and log in, then search and filter pets by species, breed, age, or location. They can view detailed information about each pet, including health status, vaccinations, and photos. Once they find a pet, users submit an adoption request that is sent to the shelter. The shelter reviews the request, communicates with the user if needed, and approves or rejects it. The system then updates the pet status and maintains comprehensive records of all adoptions.
________________________________________
3. What technologies are used?
Brief Answer:
Frontend uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript; backend is implemented in PHP; MySQL is used for data storage.
Long Answer:
The frontend is developed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap to ensure a responsive and interactive user interface. The backend is powered by PHP to handle server-side processing, including adoption workflows and user authentication. MySQL serves as the database to store information about users, pets, and adoption records efficiently. This combination of technologies ensures a secure, scalable, and maintainable system.
________________________________________
4. What was your role in the project?
Brief Answer:
I handled backend development, database design, and adoption workflow implementation.
Long Answer:
My role involved designing the database schema, writing PHP scripts for CRUD operations, managing user authentication, and implementing the adoption request workflow. I ensured data security and implemented validation and error handling. I also integrated frontend forms with the backend logic and collaborated with the team to design a user-friendly interface.
________________________________________
5. What were the challenges faced?
Brief Answer:
Managing multiple adoption requests for the same pet and ensuring consistent data across users and shelters was a major challenge.
Long Answer:
A significant challenge was handling concurrent adoption requests for the same pet while maintaining data integrity. Once a pet was adopted, it was crucial that all pending requests were updated correctly. Another challenge was designing an efficient database that securely stores pet details, adoption history, and user data, while allowing quick retrieval and scalability for future features.
________________________________________
6. How did you solve these challenges?
Brief Answer:
We added adoption status flags in the database and implemented backend checks to prevent conflicts.
Long Answer:
We implemented adoption status flags for each pet (Available, Pending, Adopted) to manage requests effectively. The backend checks the current status before approving any request, preventing conflicts. Transaction handling in MySQL ensures data integrity. If multiple users submit requests for the same pet, notifications are sent, and pending requests are automatically updated to reflect the new status.
________________________________________
7. Can you explain the architecture of your project?
Brief Answer:
The system follows a 3-tier architecture: Frontend, Backend, and Database.
Long Answer:
The Pet Adoption System uses a 3-tier web architecture:
1.       Presentation Layer (Frontend):
o       HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap
o       Displays pets, forms, adoption status, and notifications
2.       Application Layer (Backend):
o       PHP handles business logic, user authentication, adoption workflows, and notifications
3.       Data Layer (Database):
o       MySQL stores users, pets, adoption requests, and notifications
Data Flow:
Users browse pets → Backend validates requests → Database updates → Frontend shows confirmation → Shelter receives notifications

*"A pointer in C is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.
- Normal. variable: stores value - Pointer variable: stores address (location of the value)
For example, if I have int a = 10;, I can declare a pointer as int *ptr = &a;. Here, ptr stores the address of a.
I can access the value of a using the pointer by dereferencing it: *ptr gives 10.
Pointers are powerful because they let us:
•       Directly manipulate memory.
•       Pass large data structures to functions efficiently.
•       Handle arrays dynamically.
We can also do pointer arithmetic. For example, if ptr points to an array element, ptr + 1 points to the next element.
Example:
<pre><code>int arr[3] = {10, 20, 30};
int *ptr = arr;
printf("%d", *(ptr + 1)); // Prints 20</code></pre>

Normally, memory is allocated at compile time (known as static allocation).But sometimes we don't know how much memory we'll need, for example, when reading user input or creating flexible data structures.Dynamic Memory Allocation (DMA) lets us allocate memory at runtime using functions from the &lt;stdlib.h&gt; library.
There are four main functions used for this: malloc(), calloc(), realloc(), and free(). I’ll explain each one with examples."*
________________________________________
1. malloc() – Memory Allocation
*"malloc() stands for memory allocation. It allocates a single block of memory of a given size in bytes. The memory is not initialized, so it may contain garbage values.
Syntax:
ptr = (castType*) malloc(sizeInBytes);
Example:
int *ptr;
ptr = (int*) malloc(5 * sizeof(int)); // Allocate memory for 5 integers
Here, ptr points to the first element of the memory block.
We should always check if malloc() succeeded:
if(ptr == NULL) {
    printf("Memory allocation failed");
}
________________________________________
2. calloc() – Contiguous Allocation
*"calloc() stands for contiguous allocation. It allocates memory for multiple elements and initializes all bits to zero.
Syntax:
ptr = (castType*) calloc(numElements, sizeOfElement);
Example:
int *ptr;
ptr = (int*) calloc(5, sizeof(int)); // 5 integers, all initialized to 0
This is useful when we want clean, initialized memory instead of garbage values.
________________________________________
3. realloc() – Reallocation
*"realloc() is used to resize previously allocated memory. This is useful if we initially allocated memory but later need more or less.
Syntax:
ptr = (castType*) realloc(ptr, newSizeInBytes);
Example:
ptr = (int*) realloc(ptr, 10 * sizeof(int)); // Resize memory to hold 10 integers
If reallocation fails, realloc() returns NULL. So it’s good to assign it to a temporary pointer to avoid losing the original memory.
________________________________________
4. free() – Deallocate Memory
*"free() is used to release memory that was previously allocated by malloc(), calloc(), or realloc().
Syntax:
free(ptr);
ptr = NULL; // Avoid dangling pointer
It is essential to free memory to prevent memory leaks, especially in large programs or long-running applications.

*"In C, a static function is a function whose scope is limited to the file in which it is declared. That means it cannot be accessed from other files, even if those files are part of the same project.
The main use of static functions is encapsulation. It helps hide internal logic and prevents other files from using or interfering with it. This also avoids name conflicts if multiple files have functions with the same name.
A static function retains its lifetime throughout the program execution, just like a global variable. But unlike global functions, it is not visible outside its file.
Example:
<pre><code>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

static void greet() {
    printf("Hello from static function!\n");
}

int main() {
    greet(); // Works fine
    return 0;
}</code></pre>
If I try to call greet() from another file, it will not work because it is static.
So, to summarize, a static function is file-private, cannot be accessed externally, and is useful for hiding internal helper functions inside a file.

    printf("%d", x);
}</code></pre>
Here, x exists only inside func() and cannot be accessed outside it.
Local variables are useful because they keep data private to the function and prevent unwanted changes from other parts of the program."*

*"In C, control statements help us control the flow of the program. There are four main ones: break, continue, goto, and return.
________________________________________
1. break
•       break is used to exit from a loop or switch immediately.
•       Example:
<pre><code>for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if(i == 3) break;
    printf("%d ", i);
}
// Output: 1 2</code></pre>
Here, the loop stops when i becomes 3.
________________________________________
2. continue
•       continue skips the current iteration and goes to the next iteration of the loop.
•       Example:
<pre><code>for(int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    if(i == 3) continue;
    printf("%d ", i);
}
// Output: 1 2 4 5</code></pre>
Here, 3 is skipped, but the loop continues.
________________________________________
3. goto
•       goto jumps to a labeled part of the program.
•       Example:
<pre><code>int i = 1;
label:
printf("%d ", i);
i++;
if(i <= 3) goto label;
// Output: 1 2 3</code></pre>
goto can make code messy, so it’s usually avoided in structured programming.
________________________________________
4. return
•       return exits from a function and optionally returns a value.
•       Example:
<pre><code>int sum(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
int main() {
    printf("%d", sum(2,3)); // Output: 5
    return 0;

I would say: In C, tokens are the smallest meaningful units of a program. There are six types: keywords, identifiers, constants, strings, operators, and punctuation symbols. Keywords are reserved words like int or return. Identifiers are names we give to variables or functions, like sum or main. Constants are fixed values like 10 or 'A'. Strings are characters inside double quotes like "Viji". Operators perform operations, for example +, -, or ==. And punctuation symbols like ;, {}, or () help organize the code

Solution: Always use free() to release dynamically allocated memory once it is no longer needed.

*"In C, there are two ways to pass arguments to a function: call by value and call by reference.
________________________________________
1. Call by Value
•       The function receives a copy of the variable.
•       Any changes inside the function do not affect the original variable.
•       Safer because the original data cannot be changed, but it uses extra memory for the copy.
Example:

}
int main() {
    int a = 5;

            <div class="accordion-content">
Java has many strong features that make it one of the most widely used programming languages.
Some of the main features are:

Simple: Java is easy to learn and understand because its syntax is similar to C and C++, but it removed confusing features like pointers and operator overloading.

Object-Oriented: Everything in Java is based on objects and classes, which makes the code more reusable and organized.

Platform Independent: Java code is compiled into bytecode, which can run on any machine that has a JVM. That’s why we say “Write Once, Run Anywhere.”

Secure: Java doesn’t use pointers and runs inside a virtual machine, which keeps it safe from unauthorized access.

Robust: It has strong memory management, exception handling, and garbage collection, which make programs more reliable.

Multithreaded: Java supports multiple threads, meaning it can perform several tasks at the same time.

Portable and High Performance: Because of its bytecode and Just-In-Time compiler, Java programs can run efficiently across platforms.


Example:
If I write a Java program on Windows, I can run the same .class file on Linux or macOS without changing anything.

            <div class="accordion-content">
These three are core parts of the Java environment.

JDK (Java Development Kit) is used to develop Java applications. It includes the compiler, debugger, and other tools needed for development.

JRE (Java Runtime Environment) provides the environment needed to run Java programs. It includes the JVM and the core libraries.

JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is the heart of Java. It actually runs the Java bytecode and converts it into machine code. It also manages memory and garbage collection.


So, in simple terms:
When I write and compile Java code, I use the JDK.
When I run the code, I need the JRE.
And the JVM is what executes the code line by line inside the JRE.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Platform independence means Java programs can run on any operating system without changing the code.
This happens because when we compile a Java program, it doesn’t turn into machine-specific code. Instead, it becomes bytecode, and that bytecode can run on any system that has a JVM installed.

Example:
If I write a program on Windows and compile it, I can copy that .class file and run it on a Mac or Linux machine — it will work the same.
That’s why Java is called “Write Once, Run Anywhere.”

Here’s what each word means:

public: means it’s accessible by the JVM from anywhere.

static: means the method can be called without creating an object.

void: means it doesn’t return any value.

main: is the method name recognized by the JVM as the starting point.

String[] args: is used to accept command-line inputs.


Example:
<pre><code>public class Hello {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
       System.out.println("Hello, Java!");
    }
}</code></pre>
When we run this code, the JVM looks for the main() method first.

            <div class="accordion-content">
Data types define what type of data a variable can store.
Java has two categories of data types — primitive and non-primitive.

Primitive data types are the basic types built into the language, such as int, char, boolean, float, double, byte, short, and long.
Example:
<pre><code>int age = 20;
double price = 99.99;
char grade = 'A';
boolean pass = true;</code></pre>
Non-primitive data types include String, Arrays, Classes, and Interfaces.
They are created by the programmer and store references, not actual values.
Example:
<pre><code>String name = "Suji";
int[] marks = {90, 85, 88};</code></pre>
            </div>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
In spoken form:

Primitive data types are the most basic types like int, char, and boolean. They store the actual value directly in memory.
Non-primitive data types, like Strings or Arrays, store references to the data instead of the actual value.
Also, primitives are faster and don’t have built-in methods, whereas non-primitives have many methods available.

Example:
<pre><code>int a = 10;        // primitive — stores value 10
String s = "Java";   // non-primitive — stores reference to the object
System.out.println(s.length()); // uses a method</code></pre>

            <div class="accordion-content">
A variable is a name given to a memory location that stores data.
There are three types of variables in Java:

1. Local Variable: declared inside a method or block and used only within it.
Example:
<pre><code>void show() {
    int a = 10; // local variable
   System.out.println(a);
}</code></pre>

2. Instance Variable: declared inside a class but outside any method. Each object of the class gets its own copy.
<pre><code>class Student {
    int rollNo; // instance variable
}</code></pre>

3. Static Variable: declared with the static keyword and shared by all objects of the class.
<pre><code>class Student {
    static String college = "ABC College";
}</code></pre>
            </div>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Operators are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values.

Some common types are:

Arithmetic Operators: like +, -, *, /, %

Relational Operators: like >, <, ==, !=

Logical Operators: like &&, ||, !

Assignment Operators: like =, +=, -=

Increment/Decrement: ++, --

Conditional (Ternary): ?:


Example:
<pre><code>int a = 5, b = 10;
System.out.println(a + b); // 15
System.out.println(a > b); // false
System.out.println((a < b) ? "A is smaller" : "B is smaller");</code></pre>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
In Java, the == operator checks whether two references point to the same memory location, while the .equals() method checks whether two objects have the same content.

Example:
<pre><code>String s1 = new String("Java");
String s2 = new String("Java");

System.out.println(s1 == s2);     // false - different objects
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true - same content</code></pre>
So, == compares references, and .equals() compares values.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Type casting means converting one data type into another.
There are two types:

1. Widening (Automatic Casting):
Happens automatically when converting a smaller type to a larger type, for example, int to double.
<pre><code>int a = 10;
double b = a; // automatically converts
System.out.println(b); // 10.0</code></pre>

2. Narrowing (Explicit Casting):
Requires manual conversion using parentheses, for example, double to int.
<pre><code>double x = 9.78;
int y = (int) x; // manually converts
System.out.println(y); // 9</code></pre>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
It’s a way of writing programs that focuses on objects rather than just functions or logic.
Each object represents a real-world entity and has its own data and behavior.

In OOP, we group related variables and methods into one unit called a class, and we create objects from that class to perform tasks.

Example:
<pre><code>class Car {
   void start() {
      System.out.println("Car started");
   }
}
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Car myCar = new Car(); // object creation
       myCar.start();
   }
}</code></pre>
Here, Car is a class, and myCar is an object of that class.
            </div>
        </div>

                2️⃣ What are the four main OOP principles?
                <span class="icon">❯</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
The four main principles of OOP are:

1. Encapsulation:

It means wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) into a single unit, i.e., a class.
It also hides the data using private access modifiers and allows access through getter and setter methods.
Example:
<pre><code>class Student {
   private int age;
   public void setAge(int a) { age = a; }
   public int getAge() { return age; }
}</code></pre>
Here, the age variable is hidden from outside the class — that’s encapsulation.

---

2. Inheritance:

It allows one class to use the properties and methods of another class using the extends keyword.
It promotes code reusability.
Example:
<pre><code>class Animal {
   void eat() { System.out.println("Eating..."); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
   void bark() { System.out.println("Barking..."); }
}</code></pre>
Here, the Dog class inherits the eat() method from Animal.

---

3. Polymorphism:

Polymorphism means “many forms.”
It allows the same method to perform different actions depending on the object that calls it.
It can be achieved through method overloading and method overriding.
Example:
Overloading (compile-time):
<pre><code>void show(int a) {}
void show(String b) {}</code></pre>
Overriding (runtime):
<pre><code>class A { void display() { System.out.println("A"); } }
class B extends A { void display() { System.out.println("B"); } }</code></pre>

---

4. Abstraction:

Abstraction hides unnecessary details and shows only essential information.
It can be achieved using abstract classes or interfaces.
Example:
<pre><code>abstract class Shape {
   abstract void draw();
}
class Circle extends Shape {
   void draw() { System.out.println("Drawing Circle"); }
}</code></pre>
Here, we only show what to do (draw), not how — that’s abstraction.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
A class is a blueprint or template that defines the structure and behavior of objects, while an object is an instance of that class.

In simple words, a class is like a design, and an object is the actual product built from that design.

Example:
<pre><code>class Car {
   void start() { System.out.println("Car started"); }
}
public class Main {
   public static void main(String[] args) {
       Car c1 = new Car(); // object of class Car
       c1.start();
   }
}</code></pre>
Here, Car is the class, and c1 is the object.

                <span class="icon">❯</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class.
The class that inherits is called the subclass (child), and the class being inherited from is the superclass (parent).

We use the extends keyword to inherit.

Example:
<pre><code>class Animal {
   void eat() { System.out.println("Eating"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
   void bark() { System.out.println("Barking"); }
}</code></pre>
When we run this, the Dog class can call both eat() and bark().

Types of Inheritance in Java:

1. Single Inheritance – one class inherits another.

2. Multilevel Inheritance – a class inherits another class, which in turn inherits another.

3. Hierarchical Inheritance – multiple classes inherit from a single parent class.


(Note: Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance with classes to avoid ambiguity, but it’s possible with interfaces.)

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Method Overloading:
It means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists.
It happens at compile time.
Example:
<pre><code>class Display {
   void show(int a) { System.out.println(a); }
   void show(String b) { System.out.println(b); }
}</code></pre>
Method Overriding:
It means redefining a method of the parent class in the child class.
It happens at runtime.
Example:
<pre><code>class Animal {
   void sound() { System.out.println("Animal sound"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
   void sound() { System.out.println("Dog barks"); }
}</code></pre>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
A constructor is a special method that is used to initialize objects.
It has the same name as the class and no return type.

Types of Constructors:

1. Default Constructor: created automatically if we don’t define one.
Example:
<pre><code>class Car {
    Car() { System.out.println("Car created"); }
}</code></pre>

2. Parameterized Constructor: accepts arguments to initialize values.
Example:
<pre><code>class Student {
    String name;
    Student(String n) { name = n; }
}</code></pre>

3. Copy Constructor: used to copy values from one object to another.
(Not built-in like C++, but can be created manually.)
<pre><code>Student(Student s) { name = s.name; }</code></pre>
Constructors are called automatically when an object is created.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Abstract class is used to achieve partial abstraction, while an interface is used to achieve full abstraction.

Here’s how we can explain it smoothly:

An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods.

An interface can only have abstract methods (until Java 8, after which it can also have default and static methods).

A class can extend only one abstract class but can implement multiple interfaces.


Example:
<pre><code>abstract class Animal {
   abstract void sound();
}
interface Pet {
   void play();
}</code></pre>
Use an abstract class when you want to share some common code among subclasses, and use interfaces when you want to define a contract that multiple classes can follow.

            <div class="accordion-content">
this is a reference variable that refers to the current object of the class.

Uses of this:

1. To refer to current class variables.

2. To call current class methods.

3. To pass the current object as an argument.


Example:
<pre><code>class Student {
   int id;
   Student(int id) {
       this.id = id; // differentiates between instance and local variable
   }

Here, this.id refers to the instance variable, while id on the right is the local parameter.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
The super keyword refers to the parent class object.
It’s mainly used to:

1. Call the parent class constructor.

2. Access parent class methods or variables when they are hidden by child class members.


Example:
<pre><code>class Animal {
   Animal() { System.out.println("Animal created"); }
}
class Dog extends Animal {
   Dog() {
       super(); // calls parent class constructor
      System.out.println("Dog created");
   }
}</code></pre>
Here, super() calls the parent constructor first.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
These three look similar but serve different purposes.

final is a keyword used to make variables constant, methods unchangeable, and classes non-inheritable.
Example:
<pre><code>final int x = 10; // cannot be changed</code></pre>
finally is a block used in exception handling.
It always executes whether an exception occurs or not.
Example:
<pre><code>try {
   int a = 5 / 0;
} catch (Exception e) {
  System.out.println("Error");
} finally {
  System.out.println("This block always executes");
}</code></pre>
finalize() is a method called before an object is garbage collected.
It’s used to clean up resources, though it’s rarely used in modern Java.
Example:
<pre><code>protected void finalize() {
  System.out.println("Object is destroyed");
}</code></pre>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
In Java, String, StringBuilder, and StringBuffer are used to handle text data — but they differ mainly in mutability and performance.

Let’s break it down in a way easy to remember during the interview:

String:
Strings are immutable, meaning once created, their value cannot be changed.
If you modify a String, a new object is created in memory.
<pre><code>String s1 = "Hello";
s1 = s1 + " World"; // creates a new String object</code></pre>
StringBuilder:
Introduced in Java 5, it is mutable and faster than String because it doesn’t create new objects on every change.
However, it’s not thread-safe, so it’s used in single-threaded environments.
<pre><code>StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder("Hello");
sb.append(" World");
System.out.println(sb); // Hello World</code></pre>
StringBuffer:
Also mutable, but it is thread-safe because all its methods are synchronized.
This makes it slightly slower than StringBuilder.
<pre><code>StringBuffer sbf = new StringBuffer("Hello");
sbf.append(" World");
System.out.println(sbf); // Hello World</code></pre>

👉 In short:

Use String when text doesn’t change much.

Use StringBuilder when working with strings frequently in a single thread.

Use StringBuffer when working with strings in multithreaded programs.

                <span class="icon">❯</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
No, Strings are immutable in Java.
Once a String object is created, its value cannot be changed.

If we modify a string, Java actually creates a new String object instead of changing the original.

Example:
<pre><code>String s = "Java";
s.concat(" Programming");
System.out.println(s); // Output: Java</code></pre>
Even though we used concat(), the original s is unchanged.
If we want to change it, we need to assign it again:
<pre><code>s = s.concat(" Programming");
System.out.println(s); // Output: Java Programming</code></pre>
Immutability helps make Strings secure and memory-efficient.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
There are mainly two ways to compare strings in Java:

1. Using equals() method:
This compares the content of two strings.
<pre><code>String s1 = "Java";
String s2 = "Java";
System.out.println(s1.equals(s2)); // true</code></pre>

2. Using == operator:
This compares the memory reference, not the content.
<pre><code>String s1 = new String("Java");
String s2 = new String("Java");
System.out.println(s1 == s2); // false (different memory locations)</code></pre>

👉 In interviews, say:

> “I use .equals() to compare the content of strings, and == only checks if they refer to the same memory location.”

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
We can convert a String into an integer using:

1. Integer.parseInt() method
<pre><code>String num = "100";
int number = Integer.parseInt(num);
System.out.println(number + 50); // Output: 150</code></pre>

2. Integer.valueOf() method
<pre><code>String num = "200";
Integer number = Integer.valueOf(num);
System.out.println(number + 50); // Output: 250</code></pre>

If the String contains non-numeric characters (like "12a"), these methods throw a NumberFormatException.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
An array is a collection of elements of the same data type, stored in a contiguous memory location.

It allows you to store multiple values under one variable name instead of declaring separate variables.

Declaration:
<pre><code>int[] arr;</code></pre>
Initialization:
<pre><code>arr = new int[5]; // array of size 5</code></pre>
Or directly:
<pre><code>int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};</code></pre>
Accessing elements:
<pre><code>System.out.println(arr[0]); // Output: 10</code></pre>
Arrays in Java are zero-indexed, meaning the first element is at index 0.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
A multidimensional array is an array of arrays.
It’s used to store data in a table-like structure — like rows and columns.

Example (2D array):
<pre><code>int[][] matrix = {
   {1, 2, 3},
   {4, 5, 6},
   {7, 8, 9}
};</code></pre>
Accessing elements:
<pre><code>System.out.println(matrix[0][2]); // Output: 3</code></pre>
You can also declare it as:
<pre><code>int[][] arr = new int[3][3];</code></pre>
Real-life use: matrices, tables, and grid-based problems.

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
We use the .length property to find the number of elements in an array.

Example:
<pre><code>int[] arr = {10, 20, 30, 40};
System.out.println(arr.length); // Output: 4</code></pre>
Note:

For arrays, we use length (without parentheses).

For strings, we use length() (with parentheses).


So always remember:

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Garbage Collection (GC) is the process of automatically freeing memory by destroying objects that are no longer referenced.

Helps prevent memory leaks.

Happens automatically in Java (no need to manually free memory).

Can be invoked using System.gc(), but it’s only a request, not guaranteed.

<pre><code>Student s = new Student();
s = null; // Object becomes eligible for GC</code></pre>

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
No, constructors are not inherited in Java.

Every class must define its own constructor.

A subclass can call the parent class constructor using super(), but it cannot inherit it directly.


Example:
<pre><code>class Parent {
    Parent() { System.out.println("Parent constructor"); }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    Child() { System.out.println("Child constructor"); }
}</code></pre>

No, static methods cannot be overridden, because they belong to the class, not an object.

If a child defines a static method with the same signature, it hides the parent method — this is called method hiding.

<pre><code>class Parent {
    static void display() { System.out.println("Parent"); }
}
class Child extends Parent {
    static void display() { System.out.println("Child"); }

Two types:

1. Built-in packages: java.util, java.io

Multithreading allows a program to run multiple threads simultaneously, improving performance.

Thread class: Create a thread by extending the Thread class.

Runnable interface: Create a thread by implementing Runnable (preferred because Java supports single inheritance).


Example using Runnable:
<pre><code>class MyThread implements Runnable {
    public void run() { System.out.println("Thread running"); }
}
Thread t = new Thread(new MyThread());
t.start();</code></pre>

Python is popular mainly because of its simplicity and readability — the syntax is very close to English, so it’s easy for beginners to learn.
It also supports multiple programming styles like object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.
Another reason for its popularity is that it has a huge collection of libraries — for example, NumPy and Pandas for data analysis, Django and Flask for web development, and TensorFlow for AI and machine learning.
So overall, Python is popular because it’s simple, powerful, and widely used in almost every field of computing.”

            <div class="accordion-content">
“In Python, a variable is basically a name that stores a value in memory.
It acts like a container that holds data which we can use and change throughout the program.
Unlike languages like C or Java, in Python we don’t need to declare the type of a variable — Python automatically decides the data type based on the value we assign.
For example:
name = "Viji"    # String
age = 21         # Integer
height = 5.4     # Float
is_student = True # Boolean
Here, ‘name’ is a string variable, ‘age’ is an integer, ‘height’ is a float, and ‘is_student’ is a boolean.
Now, data types define the kind of value a variable holds.
Python has several built-in data types such as:
•       int – for integers (like 5, 10, -3)
•       float – for decimal numbers (like 3.14 or 2.5)
•       str – for text or characters (like “Hello”)
•       bool – for True or False values
•       list – for ordered, changeable collections (like [1, 2, 3])
•       tuple – for ordered, unchangeable collections (like (1, 2, 3))
•       set – for unordered collections of unique items
•       dict – for key-value pairs (like {'name': 'Viji', 'age': 21})

“A list and a tuple are both used to store a collection of items in Python, but they have
some key differences:
1.       Mutability:
•       A list is mutable, which means we can change, add, or remove elements after it’s created.
•       A tuple is immutable, so once it’s created, we cannot change its elements.
2.       Syntax:
•       Lists are defined using square brackets: [1, 2, 3]
•       Tuples are defined using parentheses: (1, 2, 3)
3.       Performance:
•       Tuples are generally faster than lists because they are immutable and fixed in size.
4.       Use case:
•       Use a list when you need a collection that may change.
•       Use a tuple when you want a fixed collection of items that shouldn’t change, like coordinates or constants.
Example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list[0] = 10  # List can be modified

my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)

print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
If we append another list, it adds the whole list as one element:
my_list.append([4, 5])
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, [4, 5]]

•       extend(): Adds elements from another iterable (like a list or tuple) to the end of the list individually.
Example:
my_list = [1, 2, 3]
my_list.extend([4, 5])
print(my_list)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

“Conditional statements in Python are used to perform different actions based on whether a condition is true or false.
The main conditional statements are if, elif, and else.
•       if checks a condition, and if it’s true, the code inside it runs.
•       elif stands for ‘else if’ and is used to check another condition if the previous if was false.
•       else runs a block of code if all the previous conditions are false.
Example:

if age >= 18:
    print("You can vote")
elif age > 0:

•       The number of iterations is usually known or fixed.
Example:

“Memory management in Python is handled automatically by the Python memory manager, which makes it easier for developers because we don’t have to manually allocate or free memory like in C or C++.

Key points about Python memory management:
1.       Dynamic memory allocation:
•       Python automatically allocates memory when we create objects like variables, lists, or dictionaries.
2.       Reference counting:
•       Python keeps track of how many references point to an object.
•       When the reference count drops to zero, meaning no part of the program is using the object, Python automatically frees that memory.
3.       Garbage collection:
•       Python also uses a garbage collector to detect and remove unused objects, especially those involved in circular references.
•       The gc module can be used to interact with the garbage collector if needed.
4.       Memory pools:
•       Python uses a private heap to store all objects and data structures.
•       The memory manager manages this heap internally and ensures efficient memory usage.

Internal CSS is written inside the &lt;style&gt; tag in the &lt;head&gt; section of the same HTML file. It’s used when we want to style a single page only.
External CSS is written in a separate .css file. We link it to the HTML page using the &lt;link&gt; tag.

“The &lt;form&gt; tag is used to collect user input and send it to a server for processing.
It acts like a container for input elements such as text boxes, radio buttons, checkboxes, dropdowns, and buttons.
Each form has two important attributes — action and method.
•       The action attribute defines where the data will be sent (like a PHP or backend file).

ANS:HTML is the standard language used to create web pages, but HTML5 is its updated version with more advanced features.
The main difference is that HTML5 supports multimedia — like audio and video — directly, without needing plugins such as Flash.
It also introduced new semantic tags like &lt;header&gt;, &lt;footer&gt;, &lt;article&gt;, and &lt;section&gt; that make the structure of a webpage more meaningful.
HTML5 also has better form controls — like date pickers, email inputs, and placeholders — and it supports offline storage using localStorage and sessionStorage.
Overall, HTML5 makes web pages faster, more interactive, and mobile-friendly compared to the older HTML

In CSS, both ID and Class are used to style elements, but the main difference is in how they’re applied.
An ID is unique — it’s used for one specific element only, and we write it using a hash symbol (#).
A Class can be used for multiple elements, and we write it using a dot (.).
For example:
&lt;p id='title'&gt;Welcome&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class='text'&gt;Hello&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p class='text'&gt;Hi&lt;/p&gt;
Here, the ID ‘title’ is only for one element, but the class ‘text’ is used for more than one element.
So, we use IDs when we want to target a single element and classes when we want to style a group of elements.”

“Both GET and POST are methods used to send data from a web page to the server.
GET sends the data as part of the URL — like example.com?name=Viji&age=21.
It’s visible in the address bar and has a length limit, so it’s suitable for simple, non-sensitive requests — like searching or filtering.
POST, on the other hand, sends data in the body of the HTTP request, so it’s hidden from the URL.
It can handle large amounts of data and is more secure — that’s why it’s used for sensitive forms like login or registration.
For example, in a login form, we always use POST to keep passwords private.”

"Normalization is the process of organizing database tables to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It means dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and linking them through keys."
1. First Normal Form (1NF)
•       Each column must have atomic (indivisible) values.
•       No repeating groups or arrays.
•       Example: Instead of storing multiple phone numbers in one column, store each number in a separate row.
2. Second Normal Form (2NF)
•       Must be in 1NF.
•       No partial dependency: all non-key columns must depend on the whole primary key.
•       Example: In a table with StudentID + CourseID as a combined key, StudentName should depend only on StudentID, not the combination.
3. Third Normal Form (3NF)
•       Must be in 2NF.
•       No transitive dependency: non-key attributes should not depend on other non-key attributes.
•       Example: If StudentID → Department → DepartmentHead, separate Department and DepartmentHead into a different table.
4. Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)
•       Stronger than 3NF.
•       Every determinant must be a candidate key, especially when multiple candidate keys exist.

"Joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. They help us fetch meaningful data from multiple tables."
Types of Joins
1.       Inner Join:
o       Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
o       Example: Get students and their enrolled courses, but only if they have enrolled in at least one course.
2.       Left (Outer) Join:
o       Returns all rows from the left table, and matching rows from the right table. If there’s no match, NULL is returned for the right table.
o       Example: List all students and their courses, including students who haven’t enrolled in any course.
3.       Right (Outer) Join:
o       Returns all rows from the right table, and matching rows from the left table. NULL if no match.
o       Example: List all courses and the students enrolled, including courses with no students.
4.       Full (Outer) Join:
o       Returns all rows from both tables, with NULLs where there’s no match.
o       Example: List all students and all courses, showing NULL where no enrollment exists.
5.       Cross Join (Cartesian Product):
o       Combines every row of one table with every row of the other table.
o       Example: Pair every student with every course (used rarely).
6.       Self Join:
o       A table is joined with itself.
o       Example: Find employees and their managers from the same Employee table.

o       Example: If debiting A succeeds but crediting B fails, the debit is undone.
2.       Consistency – Data must remain valid. Database rules and constraints are preserved.
o       Example: Total balance across accounts remains the same before and after transfer.
3.       Isolation – Transactions do not interfere with each other. Each runs as if it is the only one.
o       Example: Two users cannot book the same seat at the same time.
4.       Durability – Once committed, changes are permanent. Survive system failures.

Definition:
"An ER model is a way to show how data is structured in a database. It uses entities, attributes, and relationships to give a high-level conceptual view of the data."
________________________________________
1. Entity
•       What it is: A real-world object that can be identified uniquely.
•       Example: A Student in a college, a Car, or a Book.
•       Types of entities:
1.       Strong entity: Has its own primary key and does not depend on other entities.
       Example: Student with StudentID.
2.       Weak entity: Cannot be identified alone; depends on a strong entity. Identified using a partial key + owner’s key.
       Example: Dependent of an Employee (like their child). It depends on EmployeeID + DependentName.
________________________________________
2. Attribute
•       What it is: A property that describes an entity.
•       Types with examples:
1.       Key attribute: Uniquely identifies an entity.
       Example: StudentID for Student.
2.       Composite attribute: Can be divided into smaller parts.
       Example: Name → FirstName + LastName
3.       Multivalued attribute: Can have multiple values.
       Example: A Student may have multiple PhoneNumbers.
4.       Derived attribute: Computed from other attributes.
       Example: Age can be derived from DateOfBirth.
5.       Simple attribute: Cannot be divided, holds a single value.
       Example: Gender, BloodGroup
________________________________________
3. Relationship
•       What it is: Shows association between entities.
•       Example: Student enrolls in Course.
•       Types of relationships:
1.       One-to-One (1:1): One entity maps to only one entity.
       Example: A Student has one Passport.
2.       One-to-Many (1:N): One entity maps to many entities.
       Example: A Teacher teaches many Students.
3.       Many-to-One (N:1): Many entities map to one entity.
       Example: Many Students belong to one Department.
4.       Many-to-Many (M:N): Many entities map to many entities.
       Example: Students enroll in many Courses, and Courses have many Students.
________________________________________
4. Entity Type & Entity Set
•       Entity Type: Schema for similar entities.
o       Example: Entity type Student has attributes StudentID, Name, Age.
•       Entity Set: Collection of all instances of that entity at a point in time.
o       Example: All students in the college today.
________________________________________
5. Mapping ER to Tables (Relations)
•       Strong entity: Directly maps to a table using its primary key.
•       Weak entity: Table with combined key (owner key + partial key) + foreign key reference.
•       One-to-Many: Add a foreign key on the many side.
•       One-to-One: Add a foreign key on either side with UNIQUE constraint.
•       Many-to-Many: Create a junction table with both foreign keys as composite primary key.
•       Multivalued attribute: Map to separate table.

Example of a Transaction
Consider a money transfer from Account A to Account B:
BEGIN;
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance - 1000 WHERE AccNo = 'A';
UPDATE Account SET Balance = Balance + 1000 WHERE AccNo = 'B';
COMMIT;

Here, the Name column cannot be left empty.
________________________________________
2. UNIQUE Constraint
•       Ensures that all values in a column are distinct.
•       Most DBMS allow one NULL value in a UNIQUE column.

"Relational Algebra is a procedural query language used in databases. It defines operators that transform input tables, or relations, into output tables, and it forms the theoretical foundation of SQL.
Selection (σ) filters rows based on a condition. For example, to get students with marks greater than 80, we use selection.
Projection (π) chooses specific columns and removes duplicates. For example, to get only the names of students, we project the Name column.
Union combines tuples from two compatible tables and removes duplicates. For example, combining two classes’ student lists.
Set Difference returns tuples in one table but not in another. For example, students enrolled in Math but not in Physics.
Intersection returns tuples present in both tables. For example, students enrolled in both Math and Physics.
Cartesian Product pairs each row of one table with every row of another, and it’s the basis for joins. For example, pairing all students with all courses.
Rename (ρ) changes table or column names to avoid confusion.
Joins combine related tuples from two tables:
•       Theta join uses a condition, like StudentID matching in Student and Enrollment.
•       Equijoin is a theta join with equality condition.
•       Natural join automatically joins tables on columns with the same name.
Division is used to find tuples related to all tuples of another relation. For example, finding students who took all courses.
Example: To compute total sales per seller and select those above 5000, we first project Seller and Amount from Sales, group by Seller and compute sum as Total, then select rows where Total > 5000."*

                Abstraction in OOPS
                <span class="icon">❯</span>
            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
Definition:
"Abstraction is the concept of hiding the internal details of an object and exposing only the necessary features to the outside world. It allows programmers to focus on what an object does, rather than how it does it."
Key Points:
1.       Abstraction simplifies complex systems by hiding unnecessary details.
2.       It helps reduce code complexity and makes programs easier to understand and maintain.
3.       Abstraction is achieved in OOPS using:
o       Abstract Classes – Classes that cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods.
o       Interfaces (in languages like Java) – Define methods without implementation, which must be implemented by child classes.
Real-world Example:
•       Driving a car:
o       You press the accelerator to increase speed.
o       You don’t need to know how the engine works internally.
•       The remote control of a TV:
o       You press buttons to change channels or volume.
o       You don’t need to know the circuits inside.
Code Example in Python:
<pre><code>from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

# Abstract class
class Vehicle(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def start(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def stop(self):
        pass

# Child class implements the abstract methods
class Car(Vehicle):
    def start(self):
        print("Car is starting...")

    def stop(self):
        print("Car has stopped.")

# Using the class
my_car = Car()
my_car.start()  # Output: Car is starting...
my_car.stop()   # Output: Car has stopped.</code></pre>
Explanation of Code:
1.       Vehicle is an abstract class with abstract methods start() and stop().
2.       Car is a concrete class that provides implementation for both methods.
3.       The user of Car only interacts with start() and stop(), without worrying about how the car actually starts or stops internally.
Benefits of Abstraction:
•       Reduces complexity – Users don’t see unnecessary details.
•       Improves maintainability – Changes in internal implementation don’t affect users.
•       Enhances security – Sensitive internal details are hidden.

                Encapsulation

            <div class="accordion-content">
"Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, usually a class. It also restricts direct access to the data by using private or protected members, so the internal state of an object is protected."
Key Points:
1.       Encapsulation hides the internal details of an object.
2.       Access to data is controlled using getter and setter methods.
3.       It improves security, modularity, and maintainability.
Real-world Example:
•       A capsule medicine contains medicine inside a protective shell. You only use it as intended, without knowing or touching what’s inside.
•       Similarly, in a program, encapsulation hides internal variables and exposes only safe methods to access or modify them.
Python Code Example:
<pre><code>class BankAccount:
    def __init__(self, balance):
        self.__balance = balance  # private variable

    # Getter method
    def get_balance(self):
        return self.__balance

    # Setter method
    def deposit(self, amount):
        if amount > 0:
            self.__balance += amount
        else:
            print("Invalid amount!")

# Using the class
account = BankAccount(1000)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1000
account.deposit(500)
print(account.get_balance())  # Output: 1500
# Direct access is not allowed: account.__balance -> Error</code></pre>
Explanation of Code:
1.       __balance is a private variable, so it cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
2.       get_balance() allows reading the balance safely.
3.       deposit() allows modifying the balance safely, with validation.
Benefits of Encapsulation:
•       Protects data from unauthorized access.
•       Improves code modularity – the class can be maintained independently.
•       Easier debugging and maintenance – all operations on data are controlled.

"Inheritance is a concept in OOPS that allows one class, called the child class, to inherit properties and methods from another class, called the parent class. This helps in reusing code and reducing redundancy."
Key Points:
•       Promotes code reusability – common code is written once in the parent class.
•       Helps in extending functionality – child class can add new features.
•       Supports hierarchical relationships between classes.
Real-world Example:
•       A Vehicle class can have properties like speed and fuel.
•       A Car class can inherit these properties and methods, and add its own features like number_of_doors.
Python Code Example:
<pre><code># Parent class
class Vehicle:
    def __init__(self, brand, speed):
        self.brand = brand
        self.speed = speed

    def show_speed(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} is running at {self.speed} km/h")

# Child class
class Car(Vehicle):
    def __init__(self, brand, speed, doors):
        super().__init__(brand, speed)  # inherit properties from Vehicle
        self.doors = doors

    def show_doors(self):
        print(f"{self.brand} has {self.doors} doors")

# Using the classes
my_car = Car("Toyota", 120, 4)
my_car.show_speed()   # Output: Toyota is running at 120 km/h
my_car.show_doors()   # Output: Toyota has 4 doors</code></pre>
Explanation of Code:
•       Vehicle is the parent class with common properties and methods.
•       Car is the child class that inherits Vehicle using super().
•       The child class can use parent methods and add its own, promoting code reuse.

                Polymorphism

            </button>
            <div class="accordion-content">
"Polymorphism means 'many forms'. It allows the same function or method name to behave differently depending on the object that calls it. This makes code more flexible and easier to maintain."
Key Points:
•       Achieved through method overriding (Python) and method overloading (other languages).
•       Lets objects of different classes respond differently to the same method call.
•       Helps in code reusability and extensibility.
1. Method Overriding (Runtime Polymorphism)
•       Happens when a child class defines a method that already exists in its parent class but provides a new implementation.
•       The method name and parameters must be the same.
•       Decided at runtime, i.e., when the program runs.
Python Example:
<pre><code>class Animal:
    def speak(self):
        print("Animal speaks")

class Dog(Animal):
    def speak(self):
        print("Dog barks")

a = Animal()
d = Dog()

a.speak()  # Output: Animal speaks
d.speak()  # Output: Dog barks</code></pre>
Explanation:
•       Animal has a generic speak() method.
•       Dog overrides speak() to provide its own behavior.
•       The same method name behaves differently depending on the object.
________________________________________
2. Method Overloading
•       Means having multiple methods with the same name but different parameters.
•       Python does not support traditional compile-time overloading; the last defined method overrides previous ones.
Python Example:
<pre><code>class MathOps:
    def add(self, a, b):
        print(a + b)

    def add(self, a, b, c):
        print(a + b + c)

obj = MathOps()
obj.add(2, 3, 4)  # Output: 9</code></pre>
Explanation:
•       The first add(a, b) method is overridden by the second add(a, b, c) method.
•       Python only keeps the last defined method.

"In OOPS, a class is like a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes (data) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have. An object is a real-world instance of that class, created using the blueprint."
Python Example:
<pre><code>class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name  # attribute
        self.age = age    # attribute

    def show(self):     # method (behavior)
        print("Name:", self.name, "Age:", self.age)

# Creating an object
stu1 = Student("Jin", 21)
stu1.show()  # Output: Name: Jin Age: 21</code></pre>
Explanation:
•       Student is the class defining what a student is.
•       stu1 is an object, an instance of the Student class.
•       show() is a method that displays the student’s details.
Real-world Analogy:
•       Class: A blueprint of a house.
•       Object: A house built using that blueprint.

"A constructor is a special method in a class that is automatically called when an object is created. It is mainly used to initialize object variables with default or user-provided values."
Key Points:
•       Automatically invoked when an object is created.
•       Used to initialize attributes of the object.
•       Helps avoid calling separate methods to set initial values.
Python Example:
<pre><code>class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, age):  # Constructor
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    def show(self):
        print("Name:", self.name, "Age:", self.age)

stu1 = Student("Jin", 21)  # __init__ called automatically
stu1.show()                # Output: Name: Jin Age: 21</code></pre>
________________________________________
Types of Constructors
1.       Default Constructor:
o       Takes no parameters except self.
o       Python provides it automatically if no constructor is defined.
o       Example:
<pre><code>class Student:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Unknown"
        self.age = 0

stu = Student()
print(stu.name, stu.age)  # Output: Unknown 0</code></pre>
2.       Parameterized Constructor:
o       Takes parameters to initialize object attributes.
o       Example:
<pre><code>stu1 = Student("Jin", 21)
print(stu1.name, stu1.age)  # Output: Jin 21</code></pre>
3.       Constructor Overloading (Python doesn’t support directly):
o       In Python, we simulate it using default arguments or *args.
o       Example:
<pre><code>class Student:
    def __init__(self, name="Unknown", age=0):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

stu1 = Student()
stu2 = Student("Jin", 21)
print(stu1.name, stu1.age)  # Output: Unknown 0
print(stu2.name, stu2.age)  # Output: Jin 21</code></pre>
